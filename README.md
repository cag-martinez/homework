## Code refactoring

In this project, the web page for the company Horiseon had a broken code which was not loading the images properly, the background image was missing and parts of the page were not referencing properly when clicked, i refactored the code to make the page load properly, look clean and flow better as well as restructure some of the html code to be be easier to read. For that i did the following:

1. Changed the image souce code.
2. Added alt for the images.
3. Changed the tittle of the website to Social Solution Services.
4. Corrected the href for search engine optimization to link to the correct part of the site.
5. Corrected the image url for the background image on the site using CSS.
